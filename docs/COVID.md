# COVID-19

The safety of CFDE attendees is our top priority.  We will continue to closely monitor local and institutional policies regarding Covid-19 safety. We ask that all attendees conduct themselves in a manner that respects others and preserves public health. At present, we expect that the following will apply to our meeting:
